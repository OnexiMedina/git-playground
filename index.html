		<p>Ready to learn about version control through git? </p>

                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>... a system that tracks changes/edits while working with a set of documents, code, or projects; usually utilized
                        for team collaboration.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository...</h2>

		<p>... is leading us into war.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)">The Clone Wars</a>, that is.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>... you just said three things that all mean the same thing.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

		<p>... you're out of spoons.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                hands-on way to apply your skills to real world projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another system, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of developers collaborating across states and countries, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of work.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                programming skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>

               <h2>More about OSRE Catalyst</h2>
	       <h3>What is it?</h3>
	       <p>Starting this summer, UCSC is hosting a new program called the Open Source Research Experience Catalyst or OSRE Catalyst for short.</p>
	       <p>This program is a mentorship program whose goal is to introduce students to open source research and encourage them to pursue further into the field of open source development. The ultimate goal of our program is to introduce minority groups into the field of open source development and encourage their paticipation in open source in general.</p>
